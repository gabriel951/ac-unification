% This directory contains the PVS theory for Nominal AC-Unification. 
% The top subtheory is >> nominalunif.pvs <<
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The theory Nominal Unification consists of pvs files.

  This was specified in PVS 6.0 (available at http://pvs.csl.sri.com) over
  Mac Os and Linux platforms. Also, you will need the PVS NASA libraries
  (available at http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/ftp/larc/PVS-library). 
  Running PVS opens an Emacs window. 

  Run PVS using as context library (change context) the files
  directory.  

  To follow a proof you should place the cursor over the lemma or theorem
  you want to check and use the PVS meta commands x-step-proof (step by
  step) or x-prove.
 
The contents of the nominal unification library are described below.

atoms.pvs with the implementation of atoms.

nominal_term.pvs contains the data structure of terms 
                 Type checking will generate the additional pvs file:

term_adt.pvs     which contains all inductive proof schematta for this ADT.

fresh.pvs contains the definition and concepts related with freshness. 

tuples.pvs    contains lemmas related with the combinatory of the problem.

alpha_equivalence.pvs concerns alpha-equivalence.

substitution.pvs deals with substitutions 

aux_nominalunif.pvs contains secondary definitions and lemmas, to avoid cluttering
                    the file nominalunif.pvs

nominalunif.pvs contains the nominal ac-unification algorithm.

structure_extra.pvs includes auxiliary lemmas.
 
The hierarchy of this theory is given as below, where "V" means that the 
theory above imports the theory below:
